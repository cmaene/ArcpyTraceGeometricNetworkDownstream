A stand-alone python script for running ArcGIS's Trace Geometric Network tool to find the closest gage station found in downstreams from dams. I haven't used arcpy for a long time so it was a good refresher to me (note to myself: start using "os.path.join" instead of good-ol concatenate + ...)

Included are:

- traceGeometric.py

- test.gdb.zip : zipped geodatabase for testing

- pythonWorkedScreenshot.png : how the running process and result would look (but the python tool itself runs OUTSIDE ArcGIS. I.e. run it without opening ArcGIS - just run from Python Shell..)

Special thanks to BILL! Maggie found a kind person who willingly shared his insights and sent his script. Bill, you are a saint!
