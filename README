A stand-alone python script for running ArcGIS's Trace Geometric Network tool to find the closest gage station found in downstreams from each dams.

Included are:

- traceGeometric.py

- test.gdb.zip : zipped geodatabase for testing

- pythonWorkedScreenshot.png : how the running process and result would look (but the python tool itself runs OUTSIDE ArcGIS. I.e. run it without opening ArcGIS - just run from Python Shell..)

Special thanks to BILL! Maggie found a kind person who willingly suggest and sent his script. Bill, you are a saint!
